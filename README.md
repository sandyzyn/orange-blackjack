# Orange & Blackjack

Orange & BlackJack is a decentralized version of the classic game Blackjack, but instead of normal money, players can place bets using LUSD (Test Net currency). The game itself uses a standard deck of 52 cards with no jokers. The entire game will run via smart contracts deployed on the blockchain which ensures fairness and transparency, since anyone can see the code. Overall, this removes the intermediary of the casino, meaning that the experience is built in trust and allows the player to get a more straightforward path to profit and fun.
